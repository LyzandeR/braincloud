## Data Science

<h3> Objective </h3>

The purpose of Data science is to turn data into actions. We can use forecasting methods to predict future KPIs such as sales or stock, we can segment customers based on their characteristics, identify prime locations to open new branches, recommend the best products to individual customers... or whatever you wish for.

<h3> Benefit </h3>

Learning from historical data can help unveil future patterns.
You can train models to forecast future behaviour, optimise space, cluster  and adapt or drive your decision making to increase profitability.
Tell us what you are trying to solve, and leave it up to us. the solution lies in your data.

<h3> Tools </h3>

Our team of experts uses R and Python as the two main programming languages and the following models: 

<ol>
  <li>Statistics</li> Hypothesis testing, A/B testing
  <li>Supervised Machine Learning</li> Regression model, classification model
  <li>Unsupervised Machine Learning</li> Clustering algorithms, Optimisation models
  <li>Artificial Intelligence</li> Natural Language Processing, Deep learning
</ol>

We are always curious to find solutions in complex problems. It's our drive to utilise unstructured data and convert it to useful insights.
